# productivity_calendar
A productivity calendar generator in Python. Requires reportlab (``pip install reportlab``, compiles a bunch of C extensions so might need ``apt-get install python-dev`` etc.)

To use, run ``python generate.py x``, where x is month number (starting with 1). You'll get a PDF you can print out.

- **How to use your productivity calendar?**

- Print it out and, whenever you complete one of your tasks, write it in the box for that day. 

It works as:

* motivation tool (*"don't leave empty boxes!"*)
* positive reinforcement tool (*"look at just how much I've done!"*)
* time tracking device (*"this is how much I've done that day"*)
* scheduling helper (*"this is how much I can do in a day"*)

It starts with Mondays. I'm sorry, I'm from Europe ;-) Pull requests are welcome.
